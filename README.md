# Accessible Org Charts

This project is based upon the wonderful tool, Slickmap 2.0, by Matt Everson of Astuteo (https://www.astuteo.com/slickmap/).

Slickmap was designed to make take unordered lists representing sitemaps and render them pleasingly as graphical charts we love. It is immediately attractive as a solution because it is accessible, easily editable, and uses a singe source of truth. I want to apply this to simple organizational charts.

## Changes
- [ ] Streamline some of the affordances not needed for org charts
- [ ] Sassify the CSS
- [ ] Add styles for two more levels of depth (currently 4) to handle larger org charts
